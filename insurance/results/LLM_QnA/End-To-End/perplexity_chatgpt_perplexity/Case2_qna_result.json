  "Q17": "Since no specific policy was provided, the provider should contact United Healthcare directly to determine their requirements for genetic testing authorization. Generally, this would include submitting clinical documentation supporting medical necessity, results of prior testing (chromosomal microarray), and a letter of medical necessity from a specialist (preferably a geneticist or neurologist) explaining why WES is required over more targeted testing approaches. Prior authorization is likely required."
