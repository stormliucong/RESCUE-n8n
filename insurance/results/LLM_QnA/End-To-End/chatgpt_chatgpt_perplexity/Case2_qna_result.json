  "Q17": "The provider must submit a prior authorization request with detailed clinical information supporting medical necessity. The request should include documentation of prior testing (e.g., negative chromosomal microarray), the patient's clinical presentation, and justification for how WES would impact medical management. Coverage is unlikely unless medical necessity is clearly established per policy criteria."
