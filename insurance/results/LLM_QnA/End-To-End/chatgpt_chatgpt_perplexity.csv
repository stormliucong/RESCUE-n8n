3. Include detailed family history documentation emphasizing breast and ovarian cancer occurrences
4. Provide pertinent medical records confirming the family history
5. Include a summary indicating how the test results will influence the immediate medical care of the patient
6. Ensure genetic counseling documentation is included with the submission
