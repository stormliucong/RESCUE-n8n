Case2,Whole Exome Sequencing (WES),Not specified,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,A targeted gene panel focused on genes associated with learning difficulties would be more appropriate than WES for this clinical presentation.,Not specified,No,Diagnostic,Not specified,No,Not specified,Not listed,No,No,"Since no specific policy was provided, the provider should contact United Healthcare directly to determine their requirements for genetic testing authorization. Generally, this would include submitting clinical documentation supporting medical necessity, results of prior testing (chromosomal microarray), and a letter of medical necessity from a specialist (preferably a geneticist or neurologist) explaining why WES is required over more targeted testing approaches. Prior authorization is likely required.",,,
Case1,"Whole exome sequencing (WES), which analyzes the coding regions (exons) of all known genes to identify potential genetic variants underlying neurodevelopmental delay and seizures.",Not specified,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,,Yes,No,,Not specified,No,Yes,Not listed,No,Yes,"Submit a prior authorization request with comprehensive clinical documentation, including the patient's detailed history, results of prior chromosomal microarray testing, family history of neurodevelopmental disorders, and a statement on how WES will impact diagnosis and management. Ensure the laboratory is registered with UnitedHealthcare's Genetic Test Registry. Follow UnitedHealthcare's current submission procedures for genetic and molecular testing claims.",ACMG,Yes,Diagnostic
Case3,BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not required,No,Yes,No,,Yes,No,,Yes,No,Yes,Not listed,No,Yes,"Submit a prior authorization request to Aetna with documentation of the patient's strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer (mother with breast cancer at age 42, maternal aunt with ovarian cancer), the genetic counselor's recommendation, and clinical rationale for testing. Include the specific CPT codes for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing and any relevant clinical notes supporting medical necessity.",NCCN,Yes,Risk Assessment
Case4,BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment.,Not specified,No,No,No,Not required,No,No,No,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,No,Not specified,Yes,No,No,"To submit the claim, ensure all required clinical documentation is included, such as the test order, patientâ€™s clinical and family history, and any genetic counseling notes. Submit through the Aetna provider portal or as directed by the plan. Since the patient does not meet policy criteria, expect a denial unless additional supporting information is provided or an appeal is filed.",,,
