  "Q17": "According to the policy, prior authorization is required for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing. Documentation of clinical indications that meet medical necessity criteria must be submitted. Since this patient does not meet the clinical criteria (no personal history of cancer, no family history of breast/ovarian cancer, and no other clinical risk factors), the test would not be approved. The test was ordered by a primary care physician without specialist consultation, which does not meet Aetna's criteria for medical necessity."
