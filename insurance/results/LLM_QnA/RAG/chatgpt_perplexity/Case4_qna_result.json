  "Q17": "According to the policy, BRCA testing requires completion of the 'Aetna Breast and Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Gene Testing Prior Authorization Form' along with the Laboratory's Test Requisition Form. Documentation of specific cancer diagnosis in the proband(s) and pertinent medical records may be required. A summary indicating how this testing will change the immediate medical care of the member must also be included. The policy specifies that genetic counseling should be provided before testing, which appears to be missing in this case. Since the patient does not meet any of the high-risk criteria outlined in the policy (no family history of breast/ovarian cancer, no personal history of cancer, no known mutations in family members), the test would not be approved."
