  "Q17": "Based on the policy, this test would not be covered as the patient does not meet the medical necessity criteria. The patient has mild learning difficulties which does not meet the threshold for coverage (which requires moderate to profound intellectual disability or global developmental delay). Additionally, the test is being requested for general health screening, which is specifically excluded in the policy. If the provider believes the test is medically necessary, they would need to document more severe symptoms or clinical features that align with the policy criteria."
