Case2,Whole Exome Sequencing (WES),Yes,No,No,"Yes, ACMG",Yes,No,No,No,"Yes, No","No, Diagnostic",Not specified,No,Not specified,"Yes, 81415",No,No,"Based on the policy, this test would not be covered as the patient does not meet the medical necessity criteria. The patient has mild learning difficulties which does not meet the threshold for coverage (which requires moderate to profound intellectual disability or global developmental delay). Additionally, the test is being requested for general health screening, which is specifically excluded in the policy. If the provider believes the test is medically necessary, they would need to document more severe symptoms or clinical features that align with the policy criteria.",,,,
Case1,Whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate potential underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental delay and seizures. Gene content: all exons (protein-coding regions) of the genome.,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Not specified,Yes,No,Yes,"To submit the claim, ensure documentation includes: (1) clinical records supporting neurodevelopmental delay and seizures, (2) evidence of prior negative chromosomal microarray, (3) ordering provider is a medical geneticist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician, (4) family history of neurodevelopmental disorders, (5) genetic counseling provided, and (6) use the appropriate CPT code (81415). Check the member-specific benefit plan and any state mandates for additional requirements. Prior authorization may be required depending on the plan.",ACMG,Other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features is a supporting factor for coverage.,Diagnostic,81415 (Exome; sequence analysis)
Case3,BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment,Yes,Not specified,Yes,"Yes, NCCN",Not required,No,Yes,No,"Yes, Yes","No, Risk Assessment",Yes,No,Yes,"Yes, 81162, 81163, 81164, 81165, 81166, 81167 (BRCA1/BRCA2 full sequence analysis and duplication/deletion analysis)",No,Yes,"According to the policy, the following steps must be followed: 1) The provider must document the family history with special attention to breast and ovarian cancer, 2) Complete the 'Aetna Breast and Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Gene Testing Prior Authorization Form', 3) Submit the form along with the Laboratory's Test Requisition Form to Aetna for precertification, 4) Include documentation of specific cancer diagnosis in the proband(s) and pertinent medical records, 5) Include a summary indicating how this testing will change the immediate medical care of the member, 6) The blood specimen should not be tested until confirmation of coverage is received and the test is precertified.",,,,
Case4,BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing,Yes,Not specified,No,No,Not required,No,No,No,"Yes, No","No, Risk Assessment","Yes, No",No,Yes,"Yes, 81162, 81163, 81164, 81165, 81166, 81167, 81212, 81215, 81216, 81217",No,No,"According to the policy, BRCA testing requires completion of the 'Aetna Breast and Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Gene Testing Prior Authorization Form' along with the Laboratory's Test Requisition Form. Documentation of specific cancer diagnosis in the proband(s) and pertinent medical records may be required. A summary indicating how this testing will change the immediate medical care of the member must also be included. The policy specifies that genetic counseling should be provided before testing, which appears to be missing in this case. Since the patient does not meet any of the high-risk criteria outlined in the policy (no family history of breast/ovarian cancer, no personal history of cancer, no known mutations in family members), the test would not be approved.",,,,
