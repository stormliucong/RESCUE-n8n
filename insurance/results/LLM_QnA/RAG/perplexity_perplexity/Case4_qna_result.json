  "Q17": "According to the policy, this test would not be covered as the patient does not meet any of the medical necessity criteria. The policy specifically states that testing for gene mutations associated with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer does not meet coverage criteria for general population screening. The patient has no personal history of cancer, no family history of relevant cancers, and no other risk factors that would qualify her for testing under the policy guidelines. If the provider still wishes to pursue testing, they would need to submit a prior authorization request with documentation explaining why the test is medically necessary despite not meeting standard criteria."
