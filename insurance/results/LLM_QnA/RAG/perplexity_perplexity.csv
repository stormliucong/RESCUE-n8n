Gene content: all exons (protein-coding regions) in the genome.,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Not specified,Yes,No,Yes,"To submit the claim, ensure documentation includes: (1) clinical records supporting neurodevelopmental delay and seizures, (2) evidence of prior negative chromosomal microarray, (3) ordering provider is a medical geneticist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician, (4) family history of neurodevelopmental disorders, (5) genetic counseling provided, and (6) use the appropriate CPT code (81415).

Complete the 'Aetna Breast and Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Gene Testing Prior Authorization Form'
2. Include the Laboratory's Test Requisition Form
3. Submit documentation of the patient's family history (mother with breast cancer at age 42, maternal aunt with ovarian cancer)
4. Include a summary indicating how this testing will change the immediate medical care of the member
5. Submit for precertification before the blood specimen is tested

Case4,BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing,Yes,Not specified,No,No,Not required,No,No,No,"Yes, No","Yes, No",Yes,No,Required,Not listed,No,No,"According to the policy, this test would not be covered as the patient does not meet any of the medical necessity criteria. The policy specifically states that testing for gene mutations associated with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer does not meet coverage criteria for general population screening. The patient has no personal history of cancer, no family history of relevant cancers, and no other risk factors that would qualify her for testing under the policy guidelines. If the provider still wishes to pursue testing, they would need to submit a prior authorization request with documentation explaining why the test is medically necessary despite not meeting standard criteria.",,,,
