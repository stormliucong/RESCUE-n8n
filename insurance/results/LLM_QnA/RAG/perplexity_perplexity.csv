The policy requires that testing be targeted to a specific subset of genes related to the suspected condition. The patient's family history of sudden cardiac death at a young age supports the medical necessity of this testing.

The policy requires that for multi-gene panel testing for neuromuscular disorders to be considered medically necessary, the patient must have clinical features consistent with a neuromuscular disorder. This patient has normal motor development with only poor athletic performance noted by a school psychologist, without clinical neurology referral, prior CK testing, or relevant family history.
