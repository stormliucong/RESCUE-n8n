## ðŸ“¦ providers_generation_eval_results

This folder contains results of **in-network insurance provider generation experiments** using various prompts.

- **[Prompt]_experiment[#].csv**  
  Results for each prompt and trial number. Each CSV file contains retrieval performance for that specific prompt and trial.

- **summary_stats.csv**  
  Aggregated statistics summarizing overall experiment outcomes across all prompt trials.

## ðŸ“¦ policy_retrieval

This folder contains results of **insurance policy retrieval experiments**, where LLMs were used to find official genetic testing coverage policies.

### llm_searched/

- Structure: `[Prompt]_[Trial#]` â†’ Insurance companies  
- Contains the **raw insurance coverage policy documents retrieved by LLM**. 
Each file includes insurance provider names, retrieved file names, MD5 hash values, source links, and matching status for verifying document consistency and uniqueness per prompt and trial.

### md5/

- Structure: `[Prompt]_[Trial#]_md5.csv`  
- Contains **MD5 hash values** for each document retrieved per prompt and trial number. 

### retrieval/

- Structure: `[Prompt]_[Trial#].csv`  
- Stores the **retrieved insurance policy result summaries for each prompt and trial number**. Each file includes retrieved PDF links, webpage links, counts of retrieved and saved documents, total counts per provider, and overall aggregated statistics.

### md5_stats_by_trial.csv

- Provides **summary statistics** for MD5 hashing across all policy retrieval experiments. 

### prompt_combined_stat.csv

- Aggregated **summary statistics for the overall policy retrieval experiments**.  

## ðŸ“¦ LLM_QnA

This folder contains the results of **LLM_QnA** using two methods:

1. **End-To-End**:  
   In this method, the LLM agent searches for a suitable insurance policy based on the patient's information (insurance provider, lab test, and the state where the patient resides). The agent then summarizes the policy and answers the questions accordingly.

2. **RAG**:  
   In this method, the LLM agent utilizes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach to search for the most appropriate insurance policy based on the patient's information and then answers the questions.


### End-To-End/

- **Case[#]_qna_result.json**  
  Stores the **QnA results for each case**. Each file contains answers generated by the LLM agent.

- **ete_qna_eval_results.csv**  
  Stores the **overall evaluation results of the end-to-end experiment**.  
  Each row includes the predicted answer from the LLM agent, the gold standard answer, and the score (1 if the answers match, 0 otherwise).  
  Additionally, total correct, incorrect, and accuracy percentage (correct / total Ã— 100%) are included at the end of each case section.


### RAG/

- **Case[#]_qna_result.json**  
  Stores the **QnA results for each case generated using the RAG approach**.  
  Each file includes answers derived from the insurance policy retrieved through RAG based on the patient information.

- **RAG_qna_eval_results.csv**  
  Stores the **overall evaluation results of the RAG-based experiment**.  
  Similar to the end-to-end evaluation, this file includes the predicted answers, gold standard answers, and scores for each case.  
  Total correct, incorrect, and accuracy percentage are also summarized for each case.
