      "     - An individual with a Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPro, or Penn11 score of 2.5% or greater for a BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Individuals without a personal history of a related cancer:** Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 is considered medically necessary if any of the following conditions are met:\n",
      "     - A known BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation in a close blood relative.\n",
      "     - At least one first- or second-degree relative with a BRCA-related cancer.\n",
      "     - Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and at least one close blood relative with a BRCA-related cancer.\n",
      "     - An individual with a Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPro, or Penn11 score of 5% or greater for a BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Multi-Gene Hereditary Cancer Panel Testing:**\n",
      "   - Genetic testing with a multi-gene hereditary cancer panel in individuals with a personal history of cancer is considered medically necessary if all of the following criteria are met:\n",
      "     - The suspected hereditary cancer syndromes can be diagnosed by testing of two or more genes included in the specific hereditary cancer panel.\n",
      "     - One of the following conditions is present:\n",

      "       - At least one close blood relative diagnosed with a BRCA-related cancer at age 40 or younger.\n",
      "       - At least three close blood relatives, on the same side of the family, diagnosed with any cancer.\n",
      "       - A personal history of cancer associated with Lynch syndrome.\n",
      "       - A personal history of cancer where tumor testing results demonstrate that the cancer was MSI-high or had immunohistochemical staining showing the absence of one or more mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2).\n",
      "       - A personal history of colorectal polyposis with at least 10 adenomatous polyps, at least 2 hamartomatous polyps, or at least 5 serrated polyps/lesions proximal to the rectum.\n",
      "       - The individual has a PREMM5, MMRpro, or MMRpredict score of 2.5% or greater for having a Lynch syndrome gene mutation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Policy Rules:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Genetic Counseling:** Strongly recommended prior to testing to inform individuals about the advantages and limitations of the test as applied to their unique situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Unproven and Not Medically Necessary Indications:** Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 or multi-gene hereditary cancer panels with RNA testing is considered unproven and not medically necessary for all indications.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Prior Authorization:** Required for genetic and molecular testing performed in outpatient settings for UnitedHealthcare commercial plans and certain UnitedHealthcare Community Plans.

      "\n",
      "1. **Clinical Indications**: The member exhibits clinical features of an inheritable disease or is at direct risk of inheriting a specific mutation (pre-symptomatic).\n",

      "4. **Disease-Specific Criteria**: The member meets the criteria specific to the suspected disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Aetna provides coverage for certain specific genetic tests under defined conditions. For example, genetic testing for **Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)** is considered medically necessary in the following scenarios:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The individual exhibits signs or symptoms of AIS, such as undermasculinization of external genitalia, impaired spermatogenesis with otherwise normal testes, or absent/rudimentary müllerian structures (e.g., fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix), and the test results will directly impact clinical management.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Carrier screening for a female reproductive partner planning a pregnancy who has a family history of AIS consistent with X-linked inheritance (e.g., affected 46,XY individuals or manifesting heterozygous females [46,XX]).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Prenatal testing in the offspring of a biological parent with a confirmed AR mutation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that genetic testing for AIS is considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for identifying AR carriers in the general population and for all other indications due to insufficient evidence regarding its effectiveness.\n",
