      "\n",
      "**Coverage Criteria:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clinical Presentation:** The patient's symptoms are nonspecific and do not align with a well-defined syndrome for which a specific or targeted gene test is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Ordering Physician:** WES must be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, immunologist, or developmental pediatrician.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clinical History and Features:** The patient's clinical history strongly suggests a genetic cause, and at least one of the following features is present:\n",
      "  - Multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems\n",
      "  - Moderate, severe, or profound intellectual disability diagnosed by 18 years of age\n",
      "  - Global developmental delay\n",
      "  - Epileptic encephalopathy with onset before three years of age\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alternatively, if the clinical history suggests a genetic cause and two or more of the following features are present, WES may be considered:\n",
      "  - Congenital anomaly\n",
      "  - Significant hearing or visual impairment diagnosed by 18 years of age\n",
      "  - Laboratory abnormalities suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism (IEM)\n",
      "  - Autism spectrum disorder\n",
      "  - Neuropsychiatric condition (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder)\n",
      "  - Hypotonia or hypertonia in infancy\n",
      "  - Dystonia, ataxia, hemiplegia, neuromuscular disorder, movement disorder, or other neurologic abnormality\n",
      "  - Unexplained developmental regression, unrelated to autism or epilepsy\n",
      "  - Growth abnormality (e.g., failure to thrive, short stature, microcephaly, macrocephaly, or overgrowth)\n",
      "  - Persistent and severe immunologic or hematologic disorder\n",
      "  - Dysmorphic features\n",
      "  - Consanguinity\n",
      "  - Other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prior Authorization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior authorization is required for WES. Ordering providers must complete the prior authorization process, which may involve submitting clinical information to demonstrate that the patient meets the coverage criteria outlined above. ([uhcprovider.com](https://www.uhcprovider.com/en/prior-auth-advance-notification/genetic-molecular-lab.html?utm_source=openai))\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Comparator WES:** If WES is performed concurrently or has been previously performed on the patient, comparator WES (e.g., testing of parents or siblings) may be considered when the above criteria have been met.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Reanalysis of WES:** Reanalysis of WES after at least 18 months is considered when the initial criteria have been met, and the patient experiences additional symptoms that cannot be explained by the initial WES results, or new data or family history suggests a link between the individual's symptoms and specific genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the patient's age, clinical presentation, and family history, WES may be considered medically necessary under UnitedHealthcare's policy. It is essential to ensure that the ordering physician is one of the specified specialists and that prior authorization is obtained before proceeding with testing.\n",
