([uhcprovider.com](https://www.uhcprovider.com/en/resource-library/news/2024/changes-genetic-molecular-testing-coverage-pa-requirements.html?utm_source=openai)) These changes do not specifically pertain to whole exome sequencing (WES) for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",

      "For the 8-year-old patient with neurodevelopmental delay and seizures, covered under UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus in New Jersey, the following considerations are relevant:\n",

      "- **Prior Authorization Requirements**: UnitedHealthcare requires prior authorization for genetic and molecular testing performed in outpatient settings for commercial plans, including those in New Jersey. ([uhcprovider.com](https://www.uhcprovider.com/en/prior-auth-advance-notification/genetic-molecular-lab.html?utm_source=openai))\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Medical Necessity**: Coverage for genetic testing is contingent upon medical necessity. The patient's clinical presentation—neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, a negative chromosomal microarray, and a family history of neurodevelopmental disorders—supports the medical necessity for WES to identify potential genetic causes that may guide diagnosis and treatment.\n",

      "In summary, for this patient, prior authorization is required for WES under UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus in New Jersey. The test's coverage is likely to be approved based on its medical necessity, given the patient's clinical history. It is advisable to consult UnitedHealthcare's specific medical policies or contact their provider services for detailed criteria and to ensure compliance with all requirements.\n",
