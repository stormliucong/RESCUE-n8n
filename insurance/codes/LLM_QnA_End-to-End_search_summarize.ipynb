Failure to obtain prior authorization may result in reduced benefits.\\n\\n- **Age Requirements**: The policy applies to individuals with unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders, which can include pediatric patients.\\n\\n- **Test-Specific Coverage Conditions**: If WES has been previously performed, further genetic tests involving only exome analyses are considered investigational. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) is considered investigational for all situations not described in the policy.\\n\\nGiven the patient's clinical history of neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, and a family history of neurodevelopmental disorders, WES may be considered medically necessary under this policy. It is essential to obtain prior authorization before proceeding with the testing.\"\n",

There are no specific age restrictions for WES in pediatric patients with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders.

The patient must also have one or more of the following features: multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems; moderate, severe, or profound intellectual disability diagnosed by 18 years of age; or global developmental delay or epileptic encephalopathy with onset before 3 years of age. This policy applies to UHC commercial benefit plans and individual exchange benefit plans in all states except Colorado, Massachusetts, Nevada, and New York. The patient in question, an 8-year-old with neurodevelopmental delay and seizures who has already had a negative CMA, appears to meet several of these criteria, particularly the epileptic encephalopathy with onset before age 3 and/or global developmental delay criteria. However, it should be noted that the search results specifically mention coverage for whole-genome sequencing rather than whole-exome sequencing, which is what has been requested for this patient.\"\n",
