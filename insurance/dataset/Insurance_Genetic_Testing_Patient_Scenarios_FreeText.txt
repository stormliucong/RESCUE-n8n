P001:
A 32-year-old pregnant woman (G2P1) with advanced maternal age and abnormal ultrasound findings. She has not undergone any prior genetic testing. She is requesting cell-free fetal DNA testing to screen for fetal chromosomal abnormalities.

P002:
A 45-year-old man diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown cause. He has no prior genetic testing. His brother died suddenly at age 41. Genetic testing for cardiomyopathy genes is requested.

P003:
A 37-year-old female recently diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. She has no prior genetic testing. Her mother had ovarian cancer at age 50. A hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene panel is requested.

P004:
An 8-year-old boy with neurodevelopmental delay and seizures. Prior chromosomal microarray was negative. Whole exome sequencing is requested to explore possible genetic causes.

P005:
A healthy 41-year-old woman without any personal or family cancer history. No prior genetic testing performed. She is requesting a hereditary cancer panel for personal interest.

P006:
A 22-year-old man with mildly elevated cholesterol and no cardiac symptoms. He has no prior genetic testing and no family history of cardiac disease. He is seeking a cardiac genetic risk panel.

P007:
A 30-year-old healthy woman with no current medications or mental health issues. She has no prior genetic testing and no family history of psychiatric disorders. She is interested in pharmacogenetic testing for potential future use.

P008:
A 60-year-old man who completed cancer treatment years ago and has no evidence of disease recurrence. No prior genetic testing was done. He is requesting a tumor mutation panel for surveillance purposes.

P009:
A 34-year-old pregnant woman of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. No prior genetic testing was done. She has no known family history of genetic conditions but is seeking expanded carrier screening as part of reproductive planning.

P010:
A 15-year-old boy diagnosed with mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He has no prior genetic testing and no family history of sudden death. A hypertrophic cardiomyopathy gene panel is requested to evaluate inherited causes.
