  "Q17": "According to the policy, WES must be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. In this case, the test was ordered by a genetic counselor, which does not meet the policy requirements. To submit a claim that would be covered, the test would need to be ordered by one of the approved specialists. Additionally, documentation should include the patient's clinical history, prior testing results (including the negative chromosomal microarray), and explanation of how the results will influence medical management and clinical outcomes."
